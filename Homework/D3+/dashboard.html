          <p>Here should've been a text explaining the choosen encodings for variables, the story that would've been told and more explaining the design decisions.</p>
          <p>Since I could not get the assignment completed on time, even using late days, it is not here.</p>
          <p>The idea was to have some data, which I could not choose (the world bank really has MASSIVE amounts of data) visualised on the map both showing the differences between countries (by means of a gradient colorscale) and showing the actual datapoints on hover. Onclick it would've triggered a change in data, showing in the linegraph. The third interactive element would've been a set of selectors on the right, which would show the story that i wanted to tell.</p>
          <p>This way it would've been possible to guide viewers through the data by means of storytelling by using the premade selectors, and also enabling own exploration. One of my ideas was to visualize the correlation between something like womens participation in the workforce and GDP. Therefore telling a story (as it is happening in africa) about the importance of equality. </p>
