concrete and detailed example of how bottom up processing is influenced by top down processing, leading to a potentially wrong interpretation of “reality” by the viewer. 


Reading a book: by using the context of text you are top-down assembling a visual expectation. By using the expectation you have you can make sense out of it.
	Otherwise it would just be some ink printed on a page in rows. By knowing that you are indeed reading a book you expect to see letters, which make up words and sentences.
	This way you can interprete the inkmarkings on the page, which you otherwise could interprete i.e. as abstract art, as being letters, words and sentences because
	you expect to find these in a book. Interesting thing to note are other alphabets: you could decode the fact that you are holding a book, but because you never learned
	chinese you cannot read it. However: you still know to process the inkt on the page as being characters (even if you don't understand them) because of the context of the book
